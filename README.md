Streaming-Media-check
=====================

A Python script I'm putting together to check my media server for content avaliable on Streaming services, and offer the choice to delete, in order to save space.

To-Do:
- Add option to check Amazon Instant Video as well as Netflix.
- Option to mark movies as 'Saved', even if they are available online. Thinking of using the Plex Collection feature to mark.
- Option to delete movies as they are found.
- Different modes. Scan and report only, or scan and delete.
- Ability to search for TV Shows as well. Not sure how to handle different seasons however.
