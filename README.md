Streaming-Media-check
=====================

A Python script I'm putting together to check my media server for content avaliable on Streaming services, and offer the choice to delete, in order to save space.

To-Do:
- Add option to check Amazon Instant Video as well as Netflix.
- Option to mark movies as 'Saved', even if they are available online. Thinking of using the Plex Collection feature to mark. Also would be nice to have the script update the XML to add the movie to the 'Saved' collection.
- Option to delete movies as they are found.
- Different modes. Scan and report only, or scan and delete.
- Ability to search for TV Shows as well. Not sure how to handle different seasons however.
- Ability to move movies to another location instead of deleting. Might be handy for when Netflix no longer has the movie.
